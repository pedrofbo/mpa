# MPA Front End

Front end made to display information available through the MPA API.

The following tools were chosen for this project:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language, for its type safety.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13 framework, for its routing simplicity and server side rendering capabilities.
  - Created with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for simplifying and trivializing the styling process.
